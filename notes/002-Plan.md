# Plan

I'm partly repurposing this repo. I'll refer to the FCC example, but will do my own thing.

* I want a basic API that has zpages for livez, readyz, and healthz.
* I want tests for those endpoints with Ava.
* I want to have a Swagger endpoint in development.
* I want an endpoint that returns some data (tbd).
* I want to be able to use a query string on the endpoint.
* I want to be able to post data to the endpoint.

This is enough of a plan to start. I'll update as I go.

The zpages will be basic. For endpoints that do work, I'll build using handler -> controller -> use case -> domain objects/adapters.
